			"summary": "In this course, you will learn how to design technologies that bring people joy, rather than frustration.
			To do this, you'll learn techniques for rapidly prototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives
			— and why rapid prototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interaction design.
			You'll learn how to conduct fieldwork with people to help generate design ideas. 
			You'll learn how to make paper prototypes and low-fidelity mock-ups that are interactive — 
			and how to use these designs to get feedback from teammates, clients, and users.
		    You'll learn principles of visual design, perception and cognition so that you can effectively 
			organize and present information with your interfaces. And you'll learn how to perform and analyze controlled experiments online.
            Through a series of weekly assignments, you will complete a quarter-long project in teams of three. 
            Each week, in small design studios, you present and discuss work with peers.
            The setting for the course is mobile web applications. The constraints of this small form factor set the stage for this challenge.",
